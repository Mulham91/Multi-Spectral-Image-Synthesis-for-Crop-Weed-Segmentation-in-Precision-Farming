# Multi-Spectral-Image-Synthesis-for-Crop-Weed-Segmentation-in-Precision-Farming
 In this work, we propose an alternative solution with respect to the common data augmentation techniques, applying it to the fundamental problem of crop/weed segmentation in precision farming. Starting from real images, we create semi-artificial samples by replacing the most relevant object classes (i.e., crop and weeds) with synthesized counterparts. To do that, we employ a conditional GAN (cGAN), where the generative model is trained by conditioning the shape of the generated object. Moreover, in addition to RGB data, we take into account also near-infrared information, generating four channel multi-spectral synthetic images.
